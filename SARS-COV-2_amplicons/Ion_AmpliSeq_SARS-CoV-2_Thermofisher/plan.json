The Ion AmpliSeqâ„¢ SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel is a quick, accurate and cost-effective tool to detect SARS-CoV-2 Virus responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  The panel contains 2 pools, containing a total of 247 amplicons (242 unique ones) to detect 237 viral specific SARS-CoV-2 targets and 5 human gene expression controls to assess presence of the virus in a variety of sample types (isolates, throat and nasal swabs) and will cover all potential serotypes to help better understand epidemiology outbreaks.
