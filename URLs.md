### • [Global platform for SARS-CoV-2 analysis][1]
This is a collection of Galaxy workflows for the detection and interpretation of sequence
variants in SARS-CoV-2. It is free and can be immediately accessed from the [three][6] global
Galaxy instances. Each is capable of supporting thousands of users running hundreds of
thousands of analyses per month. **Anyone** can create an account and obtain immediate access
to _as much computation as one might reasonably need_ (with a limit on the number of
concurrent analyses) and 250 Gb of disk space, which can be increased based on the needs
of an individual user.

### • GitHub [galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2][2]
The goal of this resource is to provide publicly accessible infrastructure and workflows
for SARS-CoV-2 data analyses. They currently feature three different types of analyses: Genomics,
Cheminformatics, and Proteomics.
### • [Intrahost allelic variant SARS-CoV-2 analysis for GOG-UK samples][4]
Results computed using the [Observable][3] platform and the [global platform for SARS-CoV-2 analysis][5]

### • [covid19.usegalaxy.eu][7]
A subdomain of [usegalaxy.eu][8] devoted to research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

### • [Bots for SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance using Galaxy][9]
Solutions for
- an automated way to upload newly available data into Galaxy and arrange it into collections
- trigger execution of your variation analysis workflow, and proceed with downstream workflows
for consensus building and reporting as soon as the variation workflow finishes
- arrange the workflow results into batch-specific histories
